        <h1>The Motivation</h1>
        <p>Think about the last time you had to come up with a pitch or idea for your next project. You spend days gathering references, writing scripts, sketching concepts and spilling as much as you can onto paper, all while using separate platforms to carry out your brainstorming process. After you’ve resolved your idea, you have the dreary process of translating all of that presentably for client delivery. That means putting together rough drafts, press kits, scripts, contracts, style frames, prototype mock-ups, pitch bibles, etc.</p>
        <p>‘Brew’ makes the brainstorming and project delivery processes easier and more productive, whether you’re a creative staff member or lone-wolf kinda guy/gal.</p>
